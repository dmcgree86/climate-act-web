        <h1>Mandatory Climate‑Related Financial Reporting — Australia</h1>
        <p class="intro">
          Climate‑related financial reporting is changing. This factsheet
          summarises the legal basis, core disclosure requirements and the phased
          timeline for compliance with Australia’s new regime. Under
          <strong>AASB 2</strong>, physical climate risks are explicitly
          required to be disclosed, making robust, defendable quantification
          and financial interpretation critical.
        </p>

        <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div class="text-col">
            <p>
              Australia’s mandatory climate‑related financial disclosure regime
              is established through the
              <strong
                >Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and
                Other Measures) Act&nbsp;2024</strong
              >, which amends the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em>. Entities
              above certain thresholds must prepare a Sustainability Report as
              part of their annual reporting, in accordance with the Australian
              Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) issued by the AASB.
              The primary standard for climate‑related disclosures is
              <strong>AASB 2</strong>, based on IFRS S2 with modifications for
              Australia.

            <div class="icon-box"><h3>AASB 2</h3></div>
            <div class="icon-box"><h3>ASRS</h3></div>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Core Disclosure Requirement</h2>
        <p>
          Entities must disclose material information on climate‑related risks
          and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect their
          prospects, including impacts on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strategy</li>
          <li>Business model</li>
          <li>Cash flows</li>
          <li>Access to finance</li>
          <li>Cost of capital</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Risk disclosures must cover both <strong>physical risks</strong> —
          acute and chronic hazards such as cyclones, floods, droughts,
          bushfires, heatwaves and sea‑level rise — and transition risks, if
          material. Entities should specify time horizons (short, medium and
          long term) over which the effects of each risk or opportunity could
          reasonably be expected to occur.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Physical Risk Matters</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>AASB 2</strong> explicitly requires reporting on
          climate‑related physical risks. To meet these obligations and support
          strategic planning, organisations need defensible quantification of
          hazard impacts, translation into financial implications and clear
          communication of materiality. ClimateAct Analytics specialises in this
          work, providing multi‑peril, scenario‑based analysis aligned with
          reporting standards.
